      <p>So, I have planned to restart the blog again today. It would be a lot different than the previous one, I would say "boring" and staright forward without any puns or interesting/forced up gossips of the day.
        So basically today is sort of milestone for me or maybe I am just exaggerating but I really feel that  way. I finally got the invite letter from the a very super cool professor, I havent even read the whole doc he gave me for the starters but the glimpse is that he is 
        making something really cool which is also classified so I cant share it even if my blog has 0 audience. But I really wanted to work with such a project with a great vision. I need to sort out a few things before start working on the new project because I want to focus completely over it. 
        I have to automate the work of my other projects i guess I am basically thinking of making sort of a task scheduler so that a predefined and apt message is automatically sent to the team of a certain project. lets see what I finally come up with. Cheers

    ugh why it is that even if I sleep early I end up waking at 9. :/ Well I was already following the no phone day Ishita to suggested to do the same. Kal prateek se baat nahi karr paaya. :( ek toh voh itne dino baad free hua yaar, family issues se thoda. But, theek hai well NArendra ko pata nahi kya chahiye aajkal text karrta rehta hai. 
    Ayush sir ne apna naya portfolio page banaya hai kya sahi banaya hai i too have to make something like that soon.So i though to restart writing this blog previous writings are safe with me and this is the thing I do for myself so i dont care how the people who currently browse my blog would feel/ Sorry for that but i thought over this for an hour. Also finally the background is changed and now it would load much faster i guess, Also Ayush Sir ne kya sahi portfolio banaya hai apna. <aÂ href="xsmeke.me">XSMEKE</a> Awesome af. I too want to make something like this soon. 
    umm coming to the important musing of the day. Why do people set standards for themselves to achieve something in the future when they could be happy with what they have in the present. Like it isnt bad to dream of getting something but affecting your mind, body and giving a bad trip to people around you isnt right.
    Haan well I remember the day when our major 1 got over and we all hostel mates were chilling in one of the rooms discussing the paper we just gave while some being paranoid about not to discuss while some having an uncontrollable urge to do so however later the talk came over to an interesting topic idk how it proceeded to it well it was about
    what will the biotech guys do in there lives. okay so there was Dev Priya present in the room so I didnt have to care about doing the talking work or maybe you could say the arguing work cause yk people seldom talk logically and most of the times with their closed eardrums haan so electrical / cse guys and a few mnc guys vs dev priya went on like this , Himanshu who is been sending shit jokes all around the groups these days quoted : Bhai company hi nahi aati kya karoge tum log
    job hi nahi hai. Side by side some joking aiims mei compoundor ki job lagegi and stuff, ya bio hi padhni thi toh maths kyu li . and few more normie blabbers well this shows how seldom an interesting topic or a geeky/intuitie idea is discussed while a group of iitins is sitiing in a dorm room. 
    Thats not the points of today's musing this and that is an entirely differnet thing. However Dev priya wasn't doing great defending his stand as he was laughing outside to show yeah i am not hurt bitch while constantly arguing inside with himself only. 
    I was in an entirely differnet space thinkng over how people set their stds and expect others to do the same .  Also How much people hate seeing a happy man. Thats natural ofcourse but not the case with me I try to get what made that person happy. I didnt say this at that time but what i was thinking  , Ummm zyada se zyda kya hoga. Himanshu and other batti/compu/mnc(dont know the lingo for this) would have 4 chapatis in the meal and I will have 2 chapatis in the meal,  they would have a merc/audi for their ride and i would drive a maruti suzuki/hyundai , they woould be living in a mansion whereas i would be living in a 1 or 2 storey or maybe a flat 
    how does all this matter anyway. it doesn't ! untill you make it matter to you. well i am not being hard on myself or on anybody else chill maaro and think/do whatever you want to do also with I mean any general/normal 18-19-20 yr old college going guy . but whats more important i guess is to stay happy with what you have and what you got. I dont mean to be contended or satisfied what you have, rather do somethingto get outta the situation you dont like being in. Hmm
