      <p>So, Yeah I just had a nice panic attack due to the crisis going on right now, and at this time you just need some supportive people or maybe a happy uplifiting environments lacking massively in both of those, I realised the prof. under whom I am doing a project, and I havent even met her in person treats me the best </p>
    <p>
     I mean some people just can light up your mood relax you a bit, make you feel comfortable and ofcourse less dumb, I mean whats more attractive than making someone understand something that he/she doesn't know without making them feel dumb. 
    </p>
  <p>
    Also, life goes on, so how long can we wait for any crisis to end or maybe an anxiety attack, Infact I just had The most embarassing moment, I was feeling kinda puzzled and low and I literally cried not in a breakdown way but just tears roling from my eyes while I was having a meet with Adam from UCl and I literally was blacked out and zoned out for most of the meet.

  </p>
<p> After this I feel two things quite strongly, you can't wait for things to become good and anything, its just you have to work irrespective of how any one out there feels, cause people anyways gonna leave you someday. </p>
<p> I just want a long night, and I want it never to end. I just wanna get absorbed in the darkness of that night and never come out of it. But I want to be happy on that night, and not like every other night burrying my head inside the pillow carrying the heavy baggage of my own bad decisions, Does everyone has to pay this big for their bad decisions or its just me?</p>
<p> I dont even know n how to feeel h=good about me to get outta this, I have joined many self help groups and have read many blogs to prevent anxiety attacks and stuff. Its just I feel there is something that is causing this and my downfall, ughhhh this is so cursed, I am really scared to talk to Ujjwal prateek ananya Sanju as well, like Sanju really supports me but wtf I might experience a breakdown in front of any of them and that I really dont want.   </p>
<p>I am so scared, what people might be feeling about me, am I pretending this am I just okay but feeling like not okay. Everything seems to be falling apart at times, and I am having these bad attacks even if I try to write about them, </p> 
<p>The best times I had in my life were when I was with my friend Ujjwal like those were the best and other ones were when I was alone and I really would prefer that for the rest of my life, because anyways people sucksssssssss, you can be just too good to them but in the end they just suckksss, yes ya'all bloody suckkk, I dont need any bloody help from any one of you, just everyone pleaseee die, i dont need anyone i am the best on my own </p>
