      <p>So, Yeah I just had a nice panic attack due to the crisis going on right now, and at this time you just need some supportive people or maybe a happy uplifiting environments lacking massively in both of those, I realised the prof. under whom I am doing a project, and I havent even met her in person treats me the best </p>
    <p>
     I mean some people just can light up your mood relax you a bit, make you feel comfortable and ofcourse less dumb, I mean whats more attractive than making someone understand something that he/she doesn't know without making them feel dumb. 
    </p>
  <p>
    Also, life goes on, so how long can we wait for any crisis to end or maybe an anxiety attack, Infact I just had The most embarassing moment, I was feeling kinda puzzled and low and I literally cried not in a breakdown way but just tears roling from my eyes while I was having a meet with Adam from UCl and I literally was blacked out and zoned out for most of the meet.

  </p>
<p> After this I feel two things quite strongly, you can't wait for things to become good and anything, its just you have to work irrespective of how any one out there feels, cause people anyways gonna leave you someday. </p>
<p> I just want a long night, and I want it never to end. I just wanna get absorbed in the darkness of that night and never come out of it. But I want to be happy on that night, and not like every other night burrying my head inside the pillow carrying the heavy baggage of my own bad decisions, Does everyone has to pay this big for their bad decisions or its just me?</p>
<p> I dont even know n how to feeel h=good about me to get outta this, I have joined many self help groups and have read many blogs to prevent anxiety attacks and stuff. Its just I feel there is something that is causing this and my downfall, ughhhh this is so cursed, I am really scared to talk to Ujjwal prateek ananya Sanju as well, like Sanju really supports me but wtf I might experience a breakdown in front of any of them and that I really dont want.   </p>
<p>I am so scared, what people might be feeling about me, am I pretending this am I just okay but feeling like not okay. Everything seems to be falling apart at times, and I am having these bad attacks even if I try to write about them, </p> 
<p>The best times I had in my life were when I was with my friend Ujjwal like those were the best and other ones were when I was alone and I really would prefer that for the rest of my life, because anyways people sucksssssssss, you can be just too good to them but in the end they just suckksss, yes ya'all bloody suckkk, I dont need any bloody help from any one of you, just everyone pleaseee die, i dont need anyone i am the best on my own </p>
<p> everyone of you are super useless, annoying and good for nothing, this ain't a rant post or I am sad post or me trying to be just something and whatever gahahaha who all might try and feel to look cool, but just to let you all know that you all completely sucks and everything and everyone of you are just so naive to consider that the other person on the other side is making actual efforts to make you feel good when you come to him devastated/sad/confused/depressed or just want to talk to on your not so good day, and even if you are just feeling normal/low/basic which you all actually are,
  but still the other person tries his best to make you feel good hold you up, make you feel how good you are and how good you can do further and everything is just chill and its a phase of life, and that person is actually concerned for you and keeps thinking even after your convo ends that if you are okay but you suckkk so much that you didnt make a single effort of actually acknowledging the feelings of that person you just talked to and ask in return on a random day that dude if YOU are okay and everything is good. Because when he wants someone to talk to just not because he got some issues or depressed stuff but just want to talk, every one is just super busy, tired, involved, in a middle of damn fucking something and got no time to talk to the person who was expecting something from you in return and was lowkey happy that he got some one to share stuff. But you are not just a person you are someone I can actually expect something from but you are just concerned about making yourself feel uplifted the whole damn time ignoring that the other person might need you So, yeah you all just sucks and I no longer expect anything from anyone else, I am happy with my life like super happy infact i don't even need anyone basically i was just following the trend of social interaction and making acquintances even if I knew you all are just so basic, selfish, stupid, cringy, good for nothing, complete piece of shit, or just you(yeah that alone could have worked the best). So, yes sucking is the only thing you are good at, please dont text me or call me regarding this post if you somehow randomly end up landing over this and read this whole stuff, like the real truth and not just something I wrote out of frustration,
  I just wrote it to let everyone or anyone who reads this know that you basically suck.
  I dont get the whole point, like everyone is soo busy to even acknowledge someone else's actions and not just regular actions he does for you dumb heads, So busy to get a pussy, a pussy job, a feeling of mild satisfaction, validation etcetra etcetra like I am so done talking to people, make them feel happy, caring for them, picking up calls so that they might not feel bad and actually listeing stuff they say, never doing this shit again. Do whatever you want and. find someone else to talk to because thats everything about and thats what you all do, you just ignore one person for the other with whom you might be having someone to gain to. UGhhh such piece of shits you all are. So much to rant about you and your stupid useless issues and useless yuck life and so little to think about other person's similar but still farrrrrr better than your life. I was just so scared to write all of this, that what might people think about me and if they will think of me trying to seek attention and if whether i am sad or anything and how will any of my professors, colleugues or anyone I might be willing to make a good impression on will take this. BUt doesn't matter anymore because yeah really doesn;t matter and I want everyone of you to know that you all are just shits. And i am not even scared or afarid of what your empty skulls will make out of this because just like YOU all i no longer care about anything now.</p>
