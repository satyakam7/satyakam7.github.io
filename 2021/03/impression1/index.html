      <p> So, like every researcher, writer and developer has a blog these days and some people just love to write things, you never know when something interesting could pop up in your head while writing,
        So, I was thinking to start writing and like making a blog where I will put up my tech/everyday experiences and the things I came in contact with and how I did cope with a stressful situation and more of how did I even get into it.

      </p>
      <p>
        Why Would Someone be wanting to document his/her life? I mean its best to let go things of right. But at the same moment there is nothing better than learning from your own life experiences and taking a moment to realise and be thankful and grateful to all the good things you have and all the bad things you got past through.

      </p>

      <p>
        The sudden urge to write a cool thought somewhere is the perfect sign how we humans love to plan things and its fair enough without planning you won't get somewhere and life will get super chaotic.
        Like an incident happened with me in the starting of this month on 1st March, " I had a meeting with a professor from EPFL and like we had to discuss over some things related to the project I was willing to take up and I was really excited to talk to someone form EPFL,
        Like I totally idiolize Henry Markram founder of Blue Brain and Human Brain Project, and I was literally freaking out for the past week that I nailed it I can actually be in contact with someone I totally idiolize and want to become like.
        But its a saying na 'jo hona hota hai voh hota hai' I dunno how the f I got confused bwteen the dates and I ended up scheduling the meeting on 6:30 PM of 2nd of march rather than on 1st of March, The disaster took place 30 mins later when I saw her email asking if there is a change of plans? I got extremely flushed and embarrassed like wtf just did happen,
        I rushed and had a very awkward meeting and like I was totally unprepared, Though she was really nice that she was still entertaining me quite politely with a smile and that why I totally respect her." 
      </p>
      <p> At that moment I realised I have to plan and discipline my life, Now I am using Evernote and google calendars to schedule my days and also like I have started to work for limited hours cause I dont wanna be a productivity havoc I just really want some quality work produced by me rather than any quantiative work anymore</p>
    <p> Have decided to schedule and plan my stuff by priortizing the most important things first and doing what I am willing to do later on.</p>
    
    <p> will keep writing some more quality stuff here soon rather than just blabbering whatever is going on my head.</p>

  These are the impressions i want to document and for now i just know that I want to do all the good things that feels right to my heart and not care much about what other people are doing and this has to be concrete , also its wierd how we cant force ourselves to like someone even if they are good to you but they aren't physically that attractive. Just this, not overharing more.
