      <p>
        Well, the day was going great untill one of the most embarassing things happened to me, and I had nothing to do with it but in the end it was me who ended up getting up embarassed.
        So, the thing was I uploaded the poster for QuaranTeach on instagram made by Sahil. So, as usual Dhruv sent me to put it upon as he isnt much active on Instagram, so I  uploaded the profile photo sent a few requests to IITD people
        posted the Mentor Inviting poster and response was coming pretty well, untill on of the core member of CovEd texts a Hi! okay i was happy to see a rival totally unexpected of what he is gonna say! and what he said made me go super insane, HE said I appreciate the initiative by "PLEASE DO NOT COPY". Well I was kind of busy and didnt even read what was in the poster and it was ditto of what CovEd had on their poster
        Though I wont say he was wrong. But bitch please QuaranTeach is much more succesful than CovEd and in much lesser time. But in the end it was ME who had to pay for the stupidity and lack of concern of 2 people. 
        Hmmmm... this was the end.

      <p>
        I guess I have been messing up with the time a lot lately, like both CreatoSpace and MissionED are big projects and I haven't made any significant progress in CreatoSpace since long. Plus I dont like it when the people are on low enthu, "People" right here the things go wrong when you start to get affected how and what people are doing around you. Well, 'Perspective' is another word to ponder about atleast for me! I have been lately looking things through the 'perspective' of the one who I have been talking to too. LOL, pros and cons exist here too. ._. Maybe, the 'people' I have met in my past have made me so... like this "ALL MESSED UP". Pondering about small things and not letting go full of myself. Well, long story I guess. Let's leave it for later.
